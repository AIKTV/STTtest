1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:15,060
Out of control. As the man tried to swim in the speedboat round, the steering wheel came away in his hands.

2
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:25,480
He waved desperately to his companion, who had been water-skiing for the last fifty minutes.

3
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:36,400
Both men had hardly had time to realize what was happening when they were swooped violently into the sea.

4
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:45,760
The speedboat had struck a boil, but it continued to move very quickly across the water.

5
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:51,060
Both men had just begun to swim towards the shore.

6
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:54,880
When they noised with dismay,

7
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:59,940
the speedboat was moving in a cycle.

8
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:09,440
It now came straight towards them at tremendous speed in less than a minute.

9
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,240
It rolled past them only a few feet away.

10
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:21,480
After it had passed, they swam on as quickly as they could,

11
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,960
because they knew that

12
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,320
the boat would soon return.

13
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:32,460
They had just had enough time to swim out of danger

14
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:39,480
when the boat again completely acycled on this course.

15
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,700
However, it had slowed down considerably.

16
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:49,940
The petrol had nearly all been used up.

17
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,460
Before long,

18
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,960
the noise dropped completely,

19
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,600
and the boat began to draft gently across the water.
