Monster or fish?

00:04.800 --> 00:18.760
Fishermen and sailors sometimes claim to have been monsters in the sea, though people have often laughed at stories told by seamen.

00:18.760 --> 00:29.700
It is now known that many of these monsters which have at times been sighted as simply strange fish.

00:31.140 --> 00:40.000
Occasionally, unusual creatures are washed to the shore, but they are rarely caught out at sea.

00:40.640 --> 00:48.120
Some times ago, however, a peculiar fish was caught near Madagascar.

00:48.120 --> 00:59.700
A small fishing boat was carried miles out to sea by the powerful fish as it pulled on the line.

01:00.360 --> 01:11.180
Realizing that this was no ordinary fish, the fisherman made every effort not to damage it in any way.

01:11.520 --> 01:15.760
When it was eventually brought to shore,

01:15.900 --> 01:18.100
it was found to be dead.

01:18.120 --> 01:20.260
It could be over 13 feet long.

01:20.940 --> 01:31.720
It had a head like a horse, big blue eyes, shining silver skin, and a bright red tail.

01:32.160 --> 01:44.740
The fish, which has since been sent to a museum where it is being examined by a scientist, is called an oarfish.

01:44.740 --> 01:55.520
Have you ever seen an oarfish?

01:55.540 --> 01:56.880
Thanks for watching.
