48120	59700	A small fishing boat was carried miles out to sea by the powerful fish as it pulled on the line.
60360	71180	Realizing that this was no ordinary fish, the fisherman made every effort not to damage it in any way.
71520	75760	When it was eventually brought to shore,
75900	78100	it was found to be dead.
