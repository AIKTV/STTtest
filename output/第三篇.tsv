2300	15060	Out of control. As the man tried to swim in the speedboat round, the steering wheel came away in his hands.
15740	25480	He waved desperately to his companion, who had been water-skiing for the last fifty minutes.
25480	36400	Both men had hardly had time to realize what was happening when they were swooped violently into the sea.
36940	45760	The speedboat had struck a boil, but it continued to move very quickly across the water.
46400	51060	Both men had just begun to swim towards the shore.
51700	54480	When they noised with dismay,
54880	59940	the speedboat was moving in a cycle.
60460	69440	It now came straight towards them at tremendous speed in less than a minute.
70320	74240	It rolled past them only a few feet away.
75460	81480	After it had passed, they swam on as quickly as they could,
81640	83960	because they knew that
83960	86320	the boat would soon return.
87340	92460	They had just had enough time to swim out of danger
92960	99480	when the boat again completely acycled on this course.
100960	104700	However, it had slowed down considerably.
105740	109940	The petrol had nearly all been used up.
111200	112460	Before long,
112460	114960	the noise dropped completely,
115320	120600	and the boat began to draft gently across the water.
