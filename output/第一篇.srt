00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,140
Monster or fish?

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:18,760
Fishermen and sailors sometimes claim to have been monsters in the sea, though people have often laughed at stories told by seamen.

3
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:29,700
It is now known that many of these monsters which have at times been sighted as simply strange fish.

4
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:40,000
Occasionally, unusual creatures are washed to the shore, but they are rarely caught out at sea.

5
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:48,120
Some times ago, however, a peculiar fish was caught near Madagascar.

6
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:59,700
A small fishing boat was carried miles out to sea by the powerful fish as it pulled on the line.

7
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:11,180
Realizing that this was no ordinary fish, the fisherman made every effort not to damage it in any way.

8
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,760
When it was eventually brought to shore,

9
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,100
it was found to be dead.

10
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,260
It could be over 13 feet long.

11
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:31,720
It had a head like a horse, big blue eyes, shining silver skin, and a bright red tail.

12
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:44,740
The fish, which has since been sent to a museum where it is being examined by a scientist, is called an oarfish.

13
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:55,520
Have you ever seen an oarfish?

14
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,880
Thanks for watching.
