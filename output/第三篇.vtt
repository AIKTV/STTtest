00:02.300 --> 00:15.060
Out of control. As the man tried to swim in the speedboat round, the steering wheel came away in his hands.

00:15.740 --> 00:25.480
He waved desperately to his companion, who had been water-skiing for the last fifty minutes.

00:25.480 --> 00:36.400
Both men had hardly had time to realize what was happening when they were swooped violently into the sea.

00:36.940 --> 00:45.760
The speedboat had struck a boil, but it continued to move very quickly across the water.

00:46.400 --> 00:51.060
Both men had just begun to swim towards the shore.

00:51.700 --> 00:54.880
When they noised with dismay,

00:54.880 --> 00:59.940
the speedboat was moving in a cycle.

01:00.460 --> 01:09.440
It now came straight towards them at tremendous speed in less than a minute.

01:10.320 --> 01:14.240
It rolled past them only a few feet away.

01:15.460 --> 01:21.480
After it had passed, they swam on as quickly as they could,

01:21.640 --> 01:23.960
because they knew that

01:23.960 --> 01:26.320
the boat would soon return.

01:27.340 --> 01:32.460
They had just had enough time to swim out of danger

01:32.960 --> 01:39.480
when the boat again completely acycled on this course.

01:40.960 --> 01:44.700
However, it had slowed down considerably.

01:45.740 --> 01:49.940
The petrol had nearly all been used up.

01:51.200 --> 01:52.460
Before long,

01:52.460 --> 01:54.960
the noise dropped completely,

01:55.320 --> 02:00.600
and the boat began to draft gently across the water.
